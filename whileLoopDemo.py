#This program demonstrates a while loop

#Set number to 0.
#Create while loop that adds 5 to itself each iteration.
#Stop iteration at 45
#Print results

number=0

while number<=45:
    number+=5
    print(str(number)+' ', end='')

print('\nA while needs more code than a for range for the same function!')
